How i'm trying to keep my data for me.

It's been a long journey, and I think it never ends. About two years ago I red a book about data privacy and I realized that my android device was set up like something I didn't want, I said to my self:"I should start to something about it".
It wasn't so simple to find a guide to make this switch sometimes the thing listed weren't suitable for me and sometimes I didn't know what steps I needed to do and what I was wishing for, this is why I'm doing this guide, maybe someone is going to be facilitated in their transition.
