#How i'm trying to keep my data for me.

It's been a long journey, and I think it never ends. About two years ago I red a book about data privacy and I realized that my android device was set up like something I didn't want, I said to my self:"I should start to something about it".
It wasn't so simple to find a guide to make this switch sometimes the thing listed weren't suitable for me and sometimes I didn't know what steps I needed to do and what I was wishing for, this is why I'm doing this guide, maybe someone is going to be facilitated in their transition.

I had red some books about data privacy that helped to aknowledge the topic and that gave me some insight where I find out what i needed to do, or where to find the things that I was looking for, the books were: Extreme privacy 3 (now there is the fourth edition) Michael Bazzell and Privacy is power Carissa VÃ¨liz. 
There is a podcast that I follow, which is: The privacy, security and osint show; that helps to keep an eye on new things and updates.
Other sources to stay informed (since I do not (obivously) have any social media) are blogs:https://itsfoss.com, and https://gdprbuzz.com/blog/.

One of the first thing to do is limit (we'll get on this later but the main goal is limiting because privacy and data are always a shared matter, it's possible to live without some services but it is also true that you have to leave certain comforts) the usage of Google services and social media if you want software that keeps your data for you and doesn't have adds is going opensource, in particular going with free opensource software (FOSS). 

In my experience I have ubuntu on my laptop, and a custom rom on my phone, when you can't use FOSS make sure you opt out to any of the privacy and data collection flags around the app or OS you use, I always deny all the request to collect data even in if is indicated that are anonimous.
Be aware to check all your devices, even your car or television.

##Smartphone

At the beginning of my journey my first thoughts were about my phone because is a big source of data collection. My phone is a Pixel which is a Google phone, it may sounds ironic but Pixels are the best phone for install custom roms, because are studied as developer devices. 
I switched from a factory Google rom to a lineageOS rom with the gapps (the small package of gapps that i found with only the basics) installed, i was not ready to live without Big G. Right now I'm using a CalixOS with microG installed, so I don't have Google services.
After installing a custom rom, I started to look after all the apps, finding FOSS apps and alternatives to all the apps that I was using with trackers, ads and proprietary software.
I have to say that it's a long path, and today I'm still looking to replace some apps.
You can find about all the apps that have been replaced from the beginning in F-Droid, for my experience the store made of only FOSS apps.
At first my concerne were at the Gapps so I made a backup of all my data with Google takeout (an useful tool that gives you a backup of all services you want and you use in Google, you can even schedule some periodical tasks), so in case of deleting the wrong thing you can restore the files that you need, and then I made a new secure private email with Protonmail.

###Google account
Here there are many things to delete, to regain control and aknowledge: all the researches (and more) that you made in the Google are here: Maps, Gmail, Youtube etc. I deleted almost all my activity, from position that I visited in with Gmaps active to videos watched. 
Then I

###Gmail
I deleted all the emails (sent, reiceived, stored), changed all subscription (newsletters, bank, and any account where my preferred email was the one with Google), then setted that all the inbox mail will be forwarded through my Protonmail address, with this method you can't lose some important comunication (where you should change your contacts) and you don't need to login in Google and use Gmail app. If you need to have your gmail sincronized on your smartphone a good trade is use a FOSS app like K-9 mail or FairMail.
