How i'm trying to keep my data for me.

It's been a long journey, and I think it never ends. About two years ago I red a book about data privacy and I realized that my android device was set up like something I didn't want, I said to my self:"I should start to something about it".
It wasn't so simple to find a guide to make this switch sometimes the thing listed weren't suitable for me and sometimes I didn't know what steps I needed to do and what I was wishing for, this is why I'm doing this guide, maybe someone is going to be facilitated in their transition.

I had red some books about data privacy that helped to aknowledge the topic and that gave me some insight where I find out what i needed to do, or where to find the things that I was looking for, the books were: Extreme privacy 3 (now there is the fourth edition) Michael Bazzell and Privacy is power Carissa VÃ¨liz. 
There is a podcast that I follow, which is The privacy, security and osint show that helps to keep an eye on new things and updates.
Other sources to stay informed (since I do not have any social media) are blogs:https://itsfoss.com, https://gdprbuzz.com/blog/.


One of the first thing to do is limit (we'll get on this later but the main goal is limiting because privacy and data are always a shared matter, it's possible to live without some services but it is also true that you have to leave certain comforts)  the usage of Google services and social media if you want software that keeps your data for you and doesn't have adds is going opensource, in particular going with free opensource software (FOSS). In my experience I have ubuntu on my laptop, and a custom rom on my phone, when you can't use FOSS make sure you opt out to any of the privacy and data collection flags around the app or OS you use, I always deny all the request to collect data even in if is indicated that are anonimous.
Be aware to check all your devices, even your car or television.
